        <p>Efficiency is the bedrock of success for any organization. In the continuous pursuit of streamlined operations and increased productivity, ServiceNow <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/automation-engine.html">Automation Engine</a> serves as a valuable asset, enabling ServiceNow platform owners and automation leaders to quickly and cost-effectively connect or automate any system, document, or task with minimal code.</p>
        <p>Automation Engine is part of a broader <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/blogs/2023/hyperautomation-strategy-workers.html">hyperautomation strategy</a> that organizations need in order to maximize efficiency in the current and future market landscape. <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/solutions/hyperautomation-and-lowcode/what-is-hyperautomation.html">Hyperautomation</a> is focused on automating the business as much as reasonably possible, evolving people’s work to enhance their experience and impact, and applying the right tool for each need—all on a single platform.</p>
        <p>Let’s explore three ways Automation Engine can help drive a hyperautomation strategy.</p>
        <h3 id="seamless-workflow-integration">1. Seamless workflow integration</h3>
        <p>Companies are built on departments, which lead to siloed departmental systems, such as customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning. Departmental leaders then implement automation tools, such as <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/workflows/creator-workflows/what-is-robotic-process-automation.html">robotic process automation</a> (RPA), to automate processes.</p>
        <p>These “islands of automation,” or siloed automation tools, automate at the departmental level only. Even if they're connected across departments by Centers of Excellence, they're not connected to other automation tools and technologies. Both siloed departmental systems and islands of automation act as barriers to hyperautomation.</p>
        <p>Automation Engine connects siloed departmental systems and islands of automation to make hyperautomation possible. Work flows seamlessly across the enterprise through a complete set of integration capabilities, including API integration for modern systems and RPA for legacy systems.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Automation Engine connects siloed automation tools from any vendor into a cohesive whole through <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/automation-center.html">Automation Center</a>, a centralized automation operational and analytics hub.</p>
        <p>Discover how features of Automation Engine, including generative AI, can help connect workflows across the organization in our <a href="https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/eh/1237365/lp/4227223/master-your-hyperautomation-landscape-with-connected-tools-visibility-and-roi?partnerref=blog">hyperautomation landscape</a> webinar.</p>
        <h3 id="rpa-excellence">2. RPA excellence</h3>
        <p>Besides integrating ServiceNow with legacy systems, RPA automates the “last mile” of manual, repetitive tasks that may still be slowing down workflows. These tasks could be any repeatable sequence of actions that humans have to do in Windows apps, web browsers, or legacy system UIs as part of a larger business process.</p>
        <h3 id="accessible-low-code-automation">3. Accessible low-code automation</h3>
        <p>We live in an era where automation should be readily accessible to everyone. Through its low-code app development and automation capabilities, <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/now-platform-app-engine.html">App Engine</a> and Automation Engine together empower technical and business users to create new applications while upholding governance standards.</p>
        <p>This empowerment fosters increased collaboration between lines of business and IT, further breaking down silos within organizations and removing barriers to process improvements.</p>
        <p>For example, Hancock Whitney Bank successfully <a href="https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/eh/1237365/lp/4098230/supercharging-shared-services-with-hyperautomation-trends-and-success-stories?partnerref=blog">incorporated low-code as part of its hyperautomation strategy</a>. Find out how the bank achieved this and the valuable lessons learned in the process.</p>
